# HW2 - Object Detection (YOLO)
The task is to implement YOLO to detect and classify the objects present in the images by determining their bounding boxes.

For more details, please refer to the [pdf](https://github.com/kkeen699/DLCV-spring2019/blob/master/hw2/DLCV_hw2.pdf) to view the slides of HW2.

## Usage
### Dataset
A shell script is provided for downloading and extracting the dataset for this assignment. For Linux users, simply use the following command.

    bash ./get_dataset.sh
The shell script will automatically download the dataset and store the data in a folder called `hw2_train_val`. Note that this command by default only works on Linux. If you are using other operating systems, you should download the dataset from [this link](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1dWX3wxwH4F9WRRk2GZJLHNRW5mv4HnPk) and unzip the compressed file manually.

### Models
There are two YOLO models. YoloV1 with VGG16_bn backbone and YOLOV1 with ResNet50 backbone

### Training
    python3 train.py <ModelName>
`<ModelName>` shoud be vgg16 or resnet
### Prediction
Run `predict.py` will output predition files.

`hw2.sh` is the shell script file for running the `YoloV1-vgg16bn` model (download trained model and output predition files).

`hw2_best.sh` is the shell script file for running the `YoloV1-resent50` model (download trained model and output predition files).

    bash ./hw2.sh $1 $2
    bash ./hw2_best.sh $1 $2
where `$1` is the testing images directory (e.g. `test/images`), and `$2` is the output prediction directory (e.g. `test/labelTxt_hbb_pred/` ).

### Evaluation
To evaluate your model, you can run the provided evaluation script by using the following command.

    python3 hw2_evaluation_task.py <PredictionDir> <AnnotationDir>

 - `<PredictionDir>` should be the directory to output your prediction files (e.g. `hw2_train_val/val1500/labelTxt_hbb_pred/`)
 - `<AnnotationDir>` should be the directory of ground truth (e.g. `hw2_train_val/val1500/labelTxt_hbb/`)

Note that your predicted label file should have the same filename as that of its corresponding ground truth label file (both of extension ``.txt``).

### Visualization
To visualization the ground truth or predicted bounding boxes in an image, you can run the provided visualization script by using the following command.

    python3 visualize_bbox.py <image.jpg> <label.txt>

## Results

The mAP score of YoloV1-vgg16bn on the validation set is **0.104**.

The mAP score of YoloV1-resnet50 on the validation set is **0.259**.
