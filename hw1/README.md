3. Apply the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify the testing set.

    First, determin the best k and n values by 3-fold cross-validation.
  
    |        | k = 1 | k = 3 | k = 5 
    ---------|-------|-------|------
    n = 3    | 0.704 | 0.617 | 0.521 
    n = 45   | 0.929 | 0.858 | 0.792
    n = 140  | 0.929 | 0.858 | 0.754    

    Choose k = 1, n = 45, and the recognition rate of the testing set is **0.95625**.

## Problem 3 Visual Bag-of-Words

1. Use the k-means algorithm to divide the training patches into k clusters. And then randomly select 6 clusters to construct the 3-dimensional PCA subspace.

2. Choose one image from each category and visualize its BoW using histogram plot

   Adopt the k-NN to perform classification using the above BoW features (k=5), and the c;assification accuracy is **0.558**.
